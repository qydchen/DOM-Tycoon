# DOM-Tycoon

DOM-Tycoon is an incredibly lightweight library built using vanilla JavaScript that replicates functionality of jQuery. The library assists in HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and dispatching AJAX requests.

## Using this library

  ```html
  <head>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="./js/DOMTycoon.js"   charset="utf-8"></script>
    ...
  </head>
  ```
